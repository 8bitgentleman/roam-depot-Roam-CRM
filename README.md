# Roam CRM

Roam CRM turns your graph into a _Relationship Management_ tool. Inspired by [Sivers](https://sive.rs/hundreds), and David Rockefeller's collection of [200,000 index cards](https://archive.is/zxbCA), Roam CRM keeps people and dates important to you top of mind.

## Usage Example

> **NOTE**  
> There are certain tags and templates that Roam CRM relies on; **Tags:: #people** and **#Agenda** are the most vital. While these are not currently customizable they may be in the future.

## Setup

Roam CRM is built on top of several Roam extensions. Please install them on Roam Depot:

-   [Google](https://github.com/dvargas92495/roamjs-google) by David Vargas

    1. Install Google extension from Roam Depot
    2. Add your google accounts and calendar by following that extension's README
    3. You can now automatically pull events into Daily Note

-   [Workbench](https://github.com/dvargas92495/roamjs-workbench) by David Vargas

    1. Install Workbench extension and enable the `Attribute Select` feature
    2. Navigate to the newly created page in your graph `[[roam/js/attribute-select]]`
    3. Add the attribute `Contact Frequency`
    4. Add these five options
        - `#[[A List]]`: Contact every two weeks
        - `#[[B List]]`: Contact every two months
        - `#[[C List]]`: Contact every six months
        - `#[[D List]]`: Contact once a year
        - `#[[F List]]`: Never contact
    5. This is for convenience when switching a person's contact frequency. These durations are customizable in the Roam CRM settings.

-   [Query Builder](https://github.com/dvargas92495/roamjs-query-builder) by David Vargas

    1. Install Query Builder extension
    2. Import Call Rollup Queries from Roam CRM's settings page.

## Features

### Metadata

-   Roam CRM creates metadata for each `Tags::#people` page inspired by [Matt Mochary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ti_xaV9IVvj-bklxOjNY-IeGsC-YqcgvB03qvfFQrnI/). This metadata and its structure is important, **without this structure Roam CRM will not work.**
-   Each person page must have metadata structure which looks like this. You can use the **Person Metadata Template** button in the Roam CRM settings to import a quick Roam template for this metadata structure

      <!-- FIXME UPDATE IMAGE PATH ONCE MERGED-->
-   At the bare minimum a person page must have this metadata for it to be recoginzed by Roam CRM

### Agenda Addr

Inefficient leaders waste a lot of time reaching out about or responding to one-off issues in real time. A much more efficient method is to batch your issues and discuss them all at once.

-   Make a block anywhere that has as persons name (`[[Bill Gates]]` for example) and a hashtag `#Agenda`
-   Roam CRM will automatically nest a block ref on Bill's page under an agenda attribute
-   Use a hashtag to have the extension hide the name in the Agenda, e.g. `#[[Bill Gates]]`
-   Next time you talk, you'll remember everything you wanted to tell Bill

### Contact Reminders

Set contact frequency reminders for each person. This can be customized in the settings. A modal will pop up reminding you to contact them.

-   `#[[A List]]`: Contact every two weeks
-   `#[[B List]]`: Contact every two months
-   `#[[C List]]`: Contact every six months
-   `#[[D List]]`: Contact once a year
-   `#[[F List]]`: Never contact

Within the modal you can type a quick message to each person to stay in flow. This message will be nested on their page for future reference.

### Birthday Reminders

-   Birthday reminders happen 14 days before, and on the day of. They remind you that 'Bill Gates turned 46 today.' A and B listers birthday reminders show up in the modal 14 & 7 days before as well as on the day of.

-   D and F listers do now show up at all

### Full Page CRM UI

Easially accessable through the (optional) left sidebar button or via the modal toolbar the CRM Workspace is the central hub for all your contacts and your timeline of events.

-   People
    -   A sortable list of all contacts together in one place
-   Events
    -   Birthdays, calls, meetings, and any mentions are all shown in chronological order (sorted by either the DNP they show up on or the block's creation date)
-   Home
    -   Coming soon, this will be a homepage for quick access to all CRM functionality. If you have ideas or wants for this space do reach out!

### Google Calendar Sync

Via the Google extension Roam CRM has the ability (togglable in settings) to connect to a google calendar and sync upcoming events to your graph. When enabled events in the next 7 days with more than 1 guest/attendee will be synced to your graph on the Daily Notes Page corresponding with the event date. If the event attendees, date, or details change Roam CRM will update the graph block accordingly.
