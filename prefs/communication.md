# Communication Preferences
- After each component, provide a brief summary of what’s completed.
- Classify proposed changes: Small (minor), Medium (moderate), Large (significant).
- For Large changes, outline an implementation plan and wait for approval.
- Track completed vs. pending features in responses.
- If uncertain about scope or requirements, pause and ask clarifying questions.
- Optional: Respond with polite urgency if I signal importance (e.g., “This is critical—please don’t break it!”).

> **Purpose:** Keeps AI-human communication clear and actionable. Summaries and change classification (S/M/L) quantify progress; optional emotional cues test responsiveness.
