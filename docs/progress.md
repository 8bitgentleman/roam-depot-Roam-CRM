# Implementation Progress: Customizable Event Keywords

## Current Status
Phase 1 Complete - Core infrastructure implemented with testing tools

## Completed Tasks
- Analyzed existing code to understand current event processing mechanism
- Identified integration points for custom keywords
- Created implementation plan
- Added default keyword settings with backward compatibility
- Created helper functions for managing keywords
- Refactored template generation to use custom keywords
- Added debug logging for keyword matching
- Fixed issue with keyword matching for "1:1" events
- Enhanced string comparison to be more robust
- Added testing mode support for keyword testing
- Added command palette entry for testing keyword matching

## Next Steps
Phase 2: Settings UI Component
- Create a new component for managing event keywords
- Implement UI for viewing existing keywords
- Add functionality for adding, editing, and deleting keywords
- Test UI component in isolation

## Issues/Blockers
- Fixed issue with keyword matching for "1:1" events
- Improved string comparison function
