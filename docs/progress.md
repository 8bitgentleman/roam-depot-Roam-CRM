## Next Steps
Phase 3: Integration

## Notes
This feature now has enhanced testing capabilities. Users can test template matching without modifying their database by using the "Roam CRM - Test Calendar Template Matching" command in the command palette.

The new UI allows users to customize their event keywords directly in the settings panel, making it easy to create custom templates for different types of meetings.
