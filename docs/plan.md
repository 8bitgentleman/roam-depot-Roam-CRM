# Feature Implementation Plan: Customizable Event Keywords

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to implement customizable event keywords for calendar syncing in Roam CRM. Users will be able to define custom keywords that match against event titles, specify whether multiple attendees are required, and customize the templates used when events are imported.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Add default keyword settings to ensure backward compatibility
- Create helper functions for accessing keyword settings
- Refactor event template generation to use custom keywords
- Test with default settings to ensure existing behavior remains unchanged

### Phase 2: Settings UI Component
- Create a new component for managing event keywords
- Implement UI for viewing existing keywords
- Add functionality for adding, editing, and deleting keywords
- Test UI component in isolation

### Phase 3: Integration
- Add the new settings component to the extension settings panel
- Connect the UI to the core infrastructure
- Implement save/load functionality for custom keywords
- Test full integration with Google Calendar sync

### Phase 4: Documentation & Polish
- Update README with information about the new feature
- Add tooltips and help text to the UI
- Perform final testing and bug fixes
- Prepare for release

Each phase will be implemented sequentially, with testing performed after each phase to ensure functionality is working as expected.
